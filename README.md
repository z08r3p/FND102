What part of the article do you agree with and why? 
I agree that e-sports will provide students with innovative, organizational skills and other diverse learning. In my opinion, playing games in students' spare time can help them improve different abilities, because there are various kinds of games and different games bring different experiences to students. For example, strategy games can help improve organizational skills. So, games can not only bring ways for students but also help them learn some knowledge. 
What part of the article do you disagree with and why? 
I disagree that students playing games will affect themselves. In China, most parents think that playing games is a kind of behaviour that students do not love to study, and they think that students only focus on games instead of study. However, in the United States, many universities have set up esports clubs to provide students with learning. 





Why did you choose this article? 
First of all, I am a person who likes playing games very much. In my spare time, I like to play games to kill time. I think most students will play games with more or less. This article gives me a different view on games. Games can also help me learn a lot and develop together in various aspects.
